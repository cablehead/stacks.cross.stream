<p>All <a href="https://ndyg.ca/plantings/tools-clipboard-managers">good clipboard managers</a> enable this workflow. With so many <a href="https://ndyg.ca/plantings/tools-clipboard-managers">great options</a> already available, why create another one?</p>

<p>I think of my clipboard as &quot;picking things up&quot; to move them around or redirect
them. In this sense, your system's clipboard acts as a strong proxy for your
<a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/humane-interface-the/0201379376/0201379376_ch02lev1sec3.html">&quot;locus of attention&quot;</a>
when you're using a computer.</p>
<p>A clipboard manager, then, is a tool to capture and work with your &quot;locus of
attention.&quot; It ambiently captures your current tasks and work <em>context</em>.</p>
<p>Stacks is an experimental tool for tracking and manipulating your current
context using pipes and filters. But that’s a lot to explain, so I usually just
describe it as a clipboard manager.</p>

<p>A quick note on the user experience (UX): it’s fair to say it’s still a bit
rough around the edges. If Stacks reaches a UX level similar to (neo)vim, I'd
consider that a success. It’s pretty spartan and utilitarian, so being
comfortable with the command line, or feeling adventurous, definitely helps.</p>
<p>Stacks is my personal
<a href="https://maggieappleton.com/tools-for-thought">&quot;tool for thought&quot;</a> that I use as
my daily driver. Eventually, I’d like Stacks to reach the polish of tools like
<a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>, but for now, the focus is on its experimental
nature and the underlying

<p>If you're into experimental tools and are okay with a minimalist,
utilitarian design, give Stacks a try-- I'd love to hear your thoughts!</p>
