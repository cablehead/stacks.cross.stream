<div><div class="preview markdown"><p>In the spirit of small, focused tools, Stacks doesn't include built-in window management. The idea is to combine it with a great dedicated window manager. Some candidates for macOS:</p>

<p>Use Stacks to manage your clipboard, notes, and snippets, and then use a specialized tool to handle your windows. As <a href="https://x.com/rosano">@rosano</a> writes: <a href="https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions/">&quot;Every interoperable app becomes a super-app.&quot;</a></p>
<p>In the world of window management, there are pretty much three types of tools:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Fixed Position and Size</strong>: Tools that allow you to place a window in a fixed location or size—like snapping to the right half, left half, or top-left corner of the screen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hotkey + Hover for Freeform Resize/Move</strong>: Tools that let you use hotkeys combined with mouse hovering to freely resize or move windows, offering more fluid control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Window Tiling Managers</strong>: Tools that automatically tile windows to make the best use of screen space.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>I’ve been using BetterSnapTool since 2018. For $1.99, it offers both fixed positioning (type 1) and hotkey-based freeform resizing/moving (type 2). In practice, I find myself mostly using type 2 for its flexibility.</p>
